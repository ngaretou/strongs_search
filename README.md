Strong's search

## What is this?
    
Sometimes you need a way to search Strong's numbers in certain ways. This app is an attempt to help by providing a way of searching those words quickly in a couple kinds of ways. Most importantly and the reason this exists is for prefix/stem/suffix searches.

The search term will search for the result without taking into account accents - in other words the search function strips the accents off the Strong's transliterated words. Once you're looking at the words, you can see more detail by clicking on the cards.
