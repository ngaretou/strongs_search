Strong's search

## What is this?
    
 Sometimes you need a way to search Strong's numbers in certain ways. This
      app is an attempt to help by providing a way of searching those words
      quickly in a couple kinds of ways. Most importantly and the reason this
      exists is for prefix/stem/suffix searches.

      The search term will search for the result without taking into account
      accents - in other words the search function strips the accents off the
      Strong's transliterated words.

       Once you're looking at the words, you can see more detail by clicking on
      the cards.
