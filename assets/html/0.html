    <h1>What is this?</h1>
    <p>
      Sometimes people need a way to search Strong's numbers in certain ways.
      This app is an attempt to help by providing different kinds of ways of
      searching those words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The search term will search for the result without taking into account
      accents - in other words the search function strips the accents off the
      Strong's transliterated words.
