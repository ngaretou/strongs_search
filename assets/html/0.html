    <h1>What is this?</h1>
    <p>
      Sometimes you need a way to search Strong's numbers in certain ways. This
      app is an attempt to help by providing a way of searching those words
      quickly in a couple kinds of ways. Most importantly and the reason this
      exists is for prefix/stem/suffix searches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The search term will search for the result without taking into account
      accents - in other words the search function strips the accents off the
      Strong's transliterated words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you're looking at the words, you can see more detail by clicking on
      the cards.
