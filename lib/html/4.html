    <h2>Download the file</h2>
    Click on the button and your new file will download to your Download folder. 
    <h2>Back up your old appDef file</h2>
    There are several ways to do the next step, but a good one is to rename your old appDef, copy the new appDef into the folder, and rename the new appDef name the original name. 
    <h2>Enable the new transliteration</h2>
    If you have not yet added your transliteration into SAB, just be sure to add the language in Appearance/Interface in the Lanugages tab with the same language code.

If you see problems with variables like <i>%s</i> or <i>%book</i>, you can deal with them in TECkit map by adding something like this after the SFM section:
<br><br>
<tt><pre>
----------------------------------------
; ----------<br>
; Scripture App Builder (SAB) related <br>
; ----------<br>
'%,d'                      >       '%,d'<br>
'%book '                   >       '%book '<br>
'%chapter '                >       '%chapter '<br>
'%s'                       >       '%s'<br>
----------------------------------------
</pre></tt>

    If something goes wrong or takes some time to figure out, you can go back to your backed up file.
