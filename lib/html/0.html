    <h1>What is this?</h1>
    When making an app with <a href="https://software.sil.org/scriptureappbuilder/download/">Scripture App Builder</a>, builders have the option of defining their own menu items, and SAB provides an easy way of accomplishing this. Some language groups have multiple scripts and automatic transliteration processes like <a href="https://software.sil.org/teckit/">TECkit</a> that can easily transliterate large amounts of text, and it can get tedious adding transliterated app menus one phrase at a time into SAB. This utility helps app builders by providing a way to quickly use their existing TECkit map or other transliteration process to quickly incorporate their automatically transliterated menus into SAB's menus. 
    <h2>Load your appDef</h2>
    After closing SAB, drag and drop or click the button to upload your project's appDef file.
