    <h2>Choose your languages</h2>
    Menu Helper presents all the languages currently active in your appDef file and you can choose which is the source language and what language code you'd like to use to mark the transcriptions. For example if your language is Wolof (wol) and your transliterated script is Wolofal (wfl), your source is <i>wol</i> and your destination is <i>wfl</i>. 
    <br>
    <br>
    If you have not done any transliterations in this project, click on the plus button and add the language code. 
    <br><br>
    If you have a language for which you've already done some transliterations manually, you can maintain those by keeping the 'replace existing translations' option off. If you switch <i>replace existing</i> to on, it will replace the existing transliterations.
